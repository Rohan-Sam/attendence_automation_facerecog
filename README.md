# Attendence Automation using Face_Recognition System

Description - This Systems scans the user's face which is already stored in the database and marks the attendance on the Excel sheet with Date and Time.

## How it Works
  
  The System reads and trains itself for the Image stored in the database and detects the same in real-time from the capturing device (Web-Cam).
  Then marks the respective person in the excel sheet with current date and time.
  The system can detect multiple faces and mark them at the same time.

## How to run

  1. Reads the image from which is stored in the 'Image_attedance' folder with the proper label (Name of the user/person).
  2. Run the attendance.py and thats it!!
